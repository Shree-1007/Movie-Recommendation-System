- Utilizes the Porter Stemmer for text preprocessing and improving search accuracy
- Can handle queries about movie genres, descriptions, or titles

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Porter Stemmer (NLTK)
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for building the recommendation model
- Cosine Similarity for matching movie descriptions
